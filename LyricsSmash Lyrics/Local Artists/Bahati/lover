Kama ni mapenzi nilishatafuta sana (I looked for love high and low)
Kama ni kutoswa nilishatosa kwa bana (I was rejected in many places)
Kama ni mapenzi nilishatafuta sana (I looked for love high and low)
Umkhwano wanje, songa wachinimba (?)

Refrain:
Ungekuwa nyimbo ningekucheza sana
(If you were a song I would play on repeat)
Ungekuwa zeze ningekucheza bana
(If you were a flute I would play very much)
Ungekuwa nyimbo ningekucheza sana
(If you were a flute I would play very much)
Bana sana (A lot)
You are my Lover yeah, lover yeah, yeah, yeah
L.O.V.E
Umekuwa Baba kwangu (You have been my Father) (L.O.V.E)
Roho mtakatifu (Holy Spirit) (L.O.V.E)

(Refrain)

Na utanashati ukanipa kimwana (You gave me elegance as your son)
Nayo mashairi ndani yangu kajaza (And filled my heart with poetry)
(Repeat)

Bridge:
Hii yote pokea sifa moyoni umefanya (In all this receive praise)
Maulana si kawaida Kenya wakanidata (My Lord itâ€™s not common for Kenya to accept(?) me)
Hii yote pokea sifa moyoni umefanya (In all this, receive all the praise)
Najua Afrika mtoto mama atasikika (I know I will be heard across Africa)
