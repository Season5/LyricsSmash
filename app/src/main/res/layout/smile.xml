(When I think how much better I&apos;m gonna be when this is over) I smile, even though I hurt see I smile, I know God is working so I smile, Even though I&apos;ve been here for a while (what you do?) I smile, smile.. it&apos;s so hard to look up when you&apos;ve been down. Sure would hate to see you give up now You look so much better when you smile, so smile.
